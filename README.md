# Assignment-2---Neural-Networks-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Multiclass
This project focuses on handwritten digit identification using neural networks, with a particular emphasis on multiclass classification using the softmax function. It talks about how adding non-linearity through ReLU activation is crucial for enabling the network to recognize intricate patterns in data. Three layers make up the neural network's structure: an input layer, two hidden layers activated by ReLU, and an output layer activated by softmax for class probabilities. TensorFlow and Keras are used to train the network, and the model's effectiveness is assessed by contrasting anticipated and real labels. All things considered, the assignment shows how neural networks can be used for image categorization problems.
